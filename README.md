## SPA React Task
### A simple, responsive Support Desk app.

- Created with React using Vite
- One page app showing a header with a search bar and a grid of cards of people
- A person's status is indicated by a small icon in the bottom right corner - red or green depending if he is available or not
- When you hover over a person's card, more details are revealed
- The search bar has a simple function that allows to search people by either first or last name
   
#### I have not written any tests in the app, however if I had to test anything it would be the if user input is correct (no symbols,numbers, etc.) to assure that it's working as intended and to prevent malicious actions
